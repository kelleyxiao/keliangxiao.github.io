### Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Consumer Economics  
**University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**

My research lies at the intersection of international trade and environmental economics. I investigate how trade policies influence global trade patterns and assess their downstream environmental impactsâ€”particularly greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use changes such as deforestation in Southeast Asia.
